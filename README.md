# description

HappyRouter is a mobile responsive web app that generates a randomized route of restaurant and bar specials based on a user's input. It does all of the research and planning for you by searching for active happy hours that are nearby and fall within your window, and ordering a route (max 3 places) by the soonest ending happy hour

# future features 

* BIG REFACTOR
  - users can choose a start and end point and happy hours are plotted along this route

- map markers are interactive and display name of place (and link to place)

- extra filters including price, type of place (lounge, japanese, etc), and type of happy hour (food / drink / both)

- ability to star single bar/restaurants from a route and shuffle the remaining openings

- user ability to save routes to their profile and share routes with friends via text

- restaurant/bar owners to post their happy hours to the site
